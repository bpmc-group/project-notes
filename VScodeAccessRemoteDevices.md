# VS Code To Access Remote Hosts

Your local copy of VS Code can be used to access remote hosts. After installing the Remote SSH extension(s), you can click on the >< blue icon button in the lower left corner of the screen and log into servers. ![Remote Hosts Button](img/RemoteHostsButton.png). 

This feature is useful if you need to edit a file on a remote system, for example, a config file. This can be much more convenient than using putty to SSH into the remote host or using FileZilla or WinSCP.

Once the Remote SSH extension pack is installed:

1.  Click on >< button in lower left corner.
1.  From the pop-up list, click on the "Connect to Host . . . Remote-SSH"
1.  Type in <username>@<host-name> and press Enter
1.  The first time it will ask what kind of system it is and give you a few options. Mark's non-google system will usually be Linux. 
1.  A new VS Code window will popup over the original VS Code window.
1.  When it asks, type in your <password> to the remote host.
1.  At this point you are connected to the remote host. You can open files, edit them, and save them on the remote host, all using the familiar VS Code environment.
1.  If you open a new terminal window, the terminal will be **inside the remote host** that you connected to. This is where you could issue commands to start or stop a process on the host computer.

1.  WHEN DONE:
1.  Click the >< button in lower left
1.  From the popup list, select Close Remote Connection at the bottom
1.  VS Code returns to local mode.

**NOTE:** When the remote VS Code window is opened, you can close the original VS Code window.
